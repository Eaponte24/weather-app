# Rickys Weather-App

## Description

I've created a simple and easy to use weather application to view a cities weather and 5 day forecaste to the right, its a very quick and simplistic way to view the data with just one click of a button. 

## Usage

When using my weather app all you have to do is simply add in a City name in the search field and the application will do the rest. The Temp, humidity , windspeed and a nice icon will pop up to give you a visual on it all. As well as to the right of the main card a 5 day forecast will pop up with all the same information.

## Features

Some features ive added along with my app are a random background of a landscape so you never get the same background as well as a nicely added icon for the button, when you open the page you are given with so real placeholder information, just to add in a city name and then you are prompted with all of the weather for that day and in the future!
